# collascii-rs

This is the beginnings of a rewrite of [`collascii`](https://github.com/olin/collascii), a collaborative ascii-art editor, in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

At this point the only interesting pieces are in [`examples/`](examples/) (which you [_can_ install with `cargo install --example $foo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html#option-cargo-install---example).

This repository began life as a branch on [the original collascii repo](https://github.com/olin/collascii), but has since been reworked into an independent (orphaned) history.

collascii aims to be:
- easy to install and learn
- focused on user power, [ala htop](https://hisham.hm/2020/12/18/user-power-not-power-users-htop-and-its-design-philosophy/)
- a first-class terminal experience
- collaborative
- complimentary to other editors
