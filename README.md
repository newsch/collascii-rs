# collascii-rs

This is the beginnings of a rewrite of [`collascii`](https://github.com/olin/collascii) in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

At this point the only interesting pieces are in [`examples/`](examples/) (which you [_can_ install with `cargo install collascii --example $foo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html#option-cargo-install---example).

This repository began life as a branch on the collascii repo.
